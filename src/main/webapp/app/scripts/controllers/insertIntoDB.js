Today, it is produced in many rural communities and sold in stores and by street vendors in Jamaica and abroad.Bammies have been consumed since pre-Columbian times and is believed to have originated with the native Arawak people. For centuries, it was the bread staple for rural Jamaicans until the cheaper, imported wheat flour breads became popular in the post-World War II era.In the 1990s, the United Nations and the Jamaican government established a program to revive bammy production and to market it as a modern, convenient food product.Bammy is made from bitter cassava (also called yuca and manioc in other American cultures). Traditionally, the cassava is grated and placed in a press bag (woven with thatch leaves) and placed in an outdoor press where heavy stones are loaded on. Once completely drained, but still a bit moist, the cassave is beaten in a mortar then sieved to a fine flour texture. Salt is then added to taste.The actual baking of bammies varies across Jamaican communities. Traditionally, it is made by spreading a handful of the flour evenly in a baking ring on a flat iron or griddle on the open fire. While baking, the top of the bammy is patted with a flat board and then turned over. The baking process takes about 3 minutes and the final product is a thin, foldable bread about 10\" in diameter. This is similar to traditional tortillas of Native American cultures. It can then be eaten with whatever fillings are desired.The more modern (and popular) approach is to bake thicker bammies about 6\" in diameter. These are often mass-produced in factories. When home-baked, the flour may be store-bought or made by hand-pressing. The bammy can be baked on griddles or in baking pans on a stove top. Some choose to bake it inside an oven, and to add butter and other spices before baking. Baking takes longer due to the thickness, and the final product is then cut into halves or wedges for freezing. When ready to eat, the wedges are soaked in coconut milk and then fried to a golden brown, and served with meat, fish, avocado, or other side dishes.Bammies, like wheat bread and tortillas, are served at any meal or consumed as a snack." , "ingredientName": "Cassavaflour" , "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Bammies.jpg?width=300" , "name": "Bammy" },

The recipe is very ancient and was conceived for shepherds, who used to stay far from home for months at a time. Pane carasau can last up to one year if it is kept dry. The bread can be eaten either dry or wet (with water, wine, or sauces). A similar, yeast-free bread is called carta di musica in Italian (also known as pane guttiau in Sardinian language), meaning music sheet, in reference to its large and paper-thin shape, which is so thin before cooking that a sheet of music can be read through it.Remains of the bread were found in archeological excavations of nuraghi (traditional Sardinian stone buildings) and it was therefore already eaten on the island prior to 1000 BC.The name of the bread comes from the Sardinian word \u201Ccarasare\u201D, referring to the crust of bread." , "ingredientName": "Durum wheatflour, salt,yeast, water" , "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Pane_carasau.jpg?width=300" , "name": "Pane carasau" },

Tunnbr\u00F6d can be soft or crisp, and comes in many variants depending on choice of grain, leavening agent (or lack thereof) and rolling pin. The dough is made from any combination of wheat, barley and rye; the leavening agent can be both yeast and ammonium carbonate.Soft tunnbr\u00F6d is commonly used as a wrap  for other food, not unlike a cr\u00EApe or tortilla. A popular fast food dish is soft tunnbr\u00F6d rolled around mashed potatoes and a hot dog, known as tunnbr\u00F6dsrulle (tunnbr\u00F6d roll).Another traditional old Swedish method of eating soft Tunnbr\u00F6d is burrito style, combined with mashed potatoes and roasted herring.Traditionally, tunnbr\u00F6d is eaten with Surstr\u00F6mming (fermented herring) and as dopp i grytan (lit. \"dip in the pot\")- mostly a spiced soft bread is used for this -, where the bread is soaked in the stock left from cooking the Christmas ham. Crisp tunnbr\u00F6d differs from kn\u00E4ckebr\u00F6d in being thinner and more compact, containing fewer air bubbles.The consistency and taste of thin bread can vary a lot. This is usually because recipes and preparation of the bread can vary a lot depending on bakery. Traditionally housewives would keep recipes a closely guarded secret only shared with other family members." , "ingredientName": "Wheat,barleyorryeflour" , "thumbnail": "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Tunnbr\u00F6d-2007-07-14.jpg?width=300" , "name": "Tunnbr\u00F6d" },
